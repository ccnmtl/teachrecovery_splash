### About Teach Recovery

Teach Recovery aims to provide mental health professionals with information about cognitive health in people with psychiatric disorders. There is increasing recognition that cognition is vital to optimal independent functioning, but little information about how to best address it in clinical practice. Clinicians want to be able to recognize cognitive problems and their impact among people with psychiatric illness. They want a strong foundation of knowledge for successful implementation of recovery-oriented cognitive interventions. 

Teach Recovery was designed for mental health professionals from the fields of psychiatry, psychology, nursing, social work, counseling and occupational therapy who are involved in the clinical care of people with psychiatric disorders. Learners will have access to a range of training materials that are firmly based on research and years of clinical expertise. By using a web-based platform, learners across the globe will have access to an informative, illustrative and interactive set of courses that bridge clinical science and clinical practice, Teach Recovery empowers professionals and mental health agencies to integrate effective cognitive intervention approaches with routine clinic practices, and thus optimize mental health service outcomes for the clientele they serve.

#### Alice Medalia, Ph.D.

**Professor of Medical Psychology**  
**Director of Psychiatric Rehabilitation**  
**Columbia University Medical Center**

Dr. Medalia is an international leader in the field of psychiatric rehabilitation, who focuses on the treatment of neuropsychological disorders in psychiatric illness. She developed the widely used NEAR (Neuropsychological &amp; Educational Approach to Remediation) model to help people with mental illness improve their thinking skills in such areas as attention, memory, processing speed and problem solving. She lectures and consults to agencies worldwide and conducts training workshops for clinicians who want to learn how to provide cognitive remediation to psychiatric patients. Dr Medalia works with policy makers, researchers, clinicians, families and patients to bring awareness about the impact of cognitive dysfunction on recovery. In order to facilitate greater awareness about cognition in the rehabilitation field, she started the largest conference on this topic, Cognitive Remediation in Psychiatry, which takes place the first Friday in June in New York City. Her research focuses on the factors that impact a successful recovery of neuropsychological functions. Dr Medalia's contributions as a Neuropsychologist, Researcher and Advocate of Cognitive Remediation have won her awards from professional and advocacy groups.
