                                                    The focus of Course 2 is on clinical approaches to addressing cognitive dysfunction across a range of psychiatric disorders. Upon completing this course, learners will be able to identify when cognitive intervention is warranted and what behavioral approaches are available for addressing cognitive deficits. Learners will understand the state of the research on cognitive remediation and how evidence-based cognitive remediation is structured in clinical settings. Didactic material and case examples are provided to illustrate recovery-oriented cognitive treatment planning, therapeutic approaches and techniques, and the functional impact of improving cognitive health in people with psychiatric disorders.

                                                The focus of Course 1 is on defining areas of cognitive dysfunction in people with psychotic disorders and helping learners to recognize how cognitive problems manifest in everyday life. The ability to identify areas of cognitive impairment and the functional impact of cognitive deficits is necessary for effective treatment planning. Upon completing this course, learners will understand the current research on the prevalence, severity, and course of cognitive dysfunction in people with psychotic disorders, the causes of cognitive impairment, the impact of cognitive deficits on real-world functioning, and the role of psychoeducation in the treatment of cognitive dysfunction. Didactic material and illustrative case examples highlight the importance of cognitive health as a focus of intervention and for improving quality of life.
