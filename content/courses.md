### Course 1: Cognitive Dysfunction in People with Psychotic Disorders

The focus of Course 1 is on defining areas of cognitive dysfunction in people with psychotic disorders and helping learners to recognize how cognitive problems manifest in everyday life. The ability to identify areas of cognitive impairment and the functional impact of cognitive deficits is necessary for effective treatment planning. Upon completing this course, learners will understand the current research on the prevalence, severity, and course of cognitive dysfunction in people with psychotic disorders, the causes of cognitive impairment, the impact of cognitive deficits on real-world functioning, and the role of psychoeducation in the treatment of cognitive dysfunction. Didactic material and illustrative case examples highlight the importance of cognitive health as a focus of intervention and for improving quality of life.

### Course 3: Executive Functioning Training

In this lecture you will learn about a CBT oriented group therapy to target a set of cognitive skills called Executive Functions. Upon completing this course, learners will be able to understand why we focus on Executive Functions, who can benefit from the group, what our treatment approach is, and the group structure and therapist styles that promote a successful group experience. Didactic material and case examples are provided to illustrate how the group teaches people to be motivated to apply the executive functioning skills they are learning. By following the story of one patient, we illustrate the functional impact of improving executive functioning skills in people with psychiatric disorders.
